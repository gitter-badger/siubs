## The Project

## How to Contribute

SiUBS is a open-source project. Anyone can contribute :)
Fork the project, make you contribution and send us a pull request. If it's follow our style and fill our needs, we will accept.

### Development Environment

You can configure your environment for development following some generic Ruby on Rails tutorial using rvm or rbenv. But we recommend that you use our development environment available in this repository [dev_env](https://github.com/SIUBS/dev_env). Follow the instruction and you'll be fine (we hope...).
